# Calorie-Counter-Server
Backend server for my Calorie Counter project


TODO

-Make sure having enviroment.js, multerFunctions.js, and mysqlConnection.js files are an okay thing to do

-Make sure routes are RESTful, also make sure api is RESTful overall

-Maybe move other middleware into the middleware folder. Not sure if thats really neccessary though

-Remove Cors?

-remove https and make sure everything is working correctly after moving over to NGINX as the main web server
